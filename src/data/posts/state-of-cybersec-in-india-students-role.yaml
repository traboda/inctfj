  Increasing number of spams, hacking Facebook accounts and stealing money online seems to be a routine affair in the
  21st century. With the latest advancements pushing Indian people to access their bank accounts through phones, the
  risks of being a victim to online attacks are even higher. This not only costs a huge amount to the victim organisation
  but also creates the risk of compromising users’ privacy and trust which may eventually lead to the downfall of
  Digital India.


  Defending our country from cyber attacks requires skilled professionals. It’s now time to ask, are we producing enough
  security professionals? Or do the developers still consider security as a secondary add-on to their product? The reality
  is, our country lacks skilled Cyber Security professionals. Our government employs a mere 556 cyber security professionals
  in stark contrast to China’s whopping 1.2 lakh cyber security professionals. Which means we do not have sufficient human
  resources to identify malwares, to predict the possibility of an attack, to verify the integrity of system or to
  do security testing of the infrastructure.


  A recent report has revealed that a minuscule 0.6% of graduate students are currently working in cyber security.
  These statistics strengthen the belief held by many industry experts that the cause of the skills gap originates
  from schools.


  In order to encourage the youth to participate, they need to be taught at a young age about the importance of cyber
  security and both its aspects - attack and defence, because if you do not know how to attack, then you will not
  know what to expect and you do not know how to defend.


  Several research efforts by computer security experts from across the world suggest that Capture the Flag style
  contests are a highly effective method to teach computer security. Many countries such as the United States of
  America and China have realised that cyber security preparedness is pivotal for a good position in terms of
  development on the global stage and have started conducting Capture The Flag contests for high school students to
  train them from a young age. An example is picoCTF hosted exclusively for high school students in the USA.
  This contest is organised by one of the top CTF teams from the USA and is supported by several US government
  organisations such as National Science Foundation.


  Having realised the dire need for such a training culture in India, Amrita University is organising Junior InCTF -
  an online Capture the Flag style contest specifically designed to introduce cyber security awareness and training in
  high school students. It is a simplified version of InCTF, Indian Capture The Flag, a national level ethical hacking
  contest that Amrita university hosts every year, for promoting cyber security awareness and training for college
  students in India. Now with Junior InCTF, we are pushing the boundaries of conventional wisdom by taking up school
  students and giving them career changing experience and exposure in a field filled with opportunities. Considering
  the ubiquitous nature of the field and the need for knowledge in cyber security a requirement in just about
  any profession, the contest will be useful to all students.


  Contest has already started, registration for the contest is online at our website, junior.inctf.in. Registrants will
  be given access to challenges from different areas of Security such as Web Exploitation, Binary exploitation,
  Reverse engineering, Forensics, Cryptography.  This competition aims in making students learn about security in a
  game based approach.


  We will also conduct week long workshops for the top students in Junior InCTF and train them thoroughly in cyber
  security concepts and practices - with a view to arouse their interest in this field as a career option. The
  university has already conducted two editions of the workshop - called Cyber Gurukulam - in December 2014 and May 2015
  and plans to conduct more such workshops for school students in future.


  Developing skills in the area of cyber security opens up a whole new range of career opportunities for skilled
  graduates. Today graduates with expertise in cyber security are in great demand for the positions of security analysts
  in top private computer firms in India. Of course, apart from the private computer firms the Electronic and Computer
  Science Division of DRDO (Defence Research and Development Organization) which is the government wing that currently
  handles the national cyber security, is also in need of individuals with skills, agility and a fresh and updated
  outlook at cyber security.


  With this in mind and having understood the need to raise India’s cyber security standards, Amrita has decided to
  lead the way for a new generation of students, not just interested in the field of cyber security, but also wishing
  to choose it as a career path. Foreseeing the befall of a humongous cyber plague in the near future, this is a
  roll call for yet another Indian army of cyber elites.
