  The given zip file is corrupted.
  On opening the file in a hex editor, we can find the corrupted header.

  Correct the file header from `70 4B 05 06` to `50 4B 03 04`

  Then, on unzipping we get a qr code.

  Scanning the qr code will give a b64 encoded text: `aW5jdGZqe3k0eXlfaEVyRSdzX3kwdXJfZkxhR30=`

  Decoding it will give the flag.
