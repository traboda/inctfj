  #### Decoded Result of QR Code 1

  ```
  Over hill, over dale,
  Thorough bush, thorough brier,
  Over park, over pale,
  Thorough flood, thorough fire!
  I do wander everywhere,
  Swifter than the moon's sphere;
  And I serve the Fairy _____,
  To dew her orbs upon the green;
  The cowslips tall her pensioners be;
  In their gold coats spots you see;
  Those be rubies, fairy favours;
  In those freckles live their savours;
  I must go seek some dewdrops here,
  And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.
  ```

  ```
  The _______,--why, 'twas beautiful and hard,
  Whereto his invised properties did tend;
  The deep-green emerald, in whose fresh regard
  Weak sights their sickly radiance do amend;
  The heaven-hued sapphire and the opal blend
  With objects manifold: each several stone,
  With wit well blazon'd, smiled or made some moan.
  ```

  #### Decoded Result of QR Code 3

  ```
  Thus merely with the _______ of a Grace
  The naked and concealed fiend he cover'd;
  That th' unexperient gave the tempter place,
  Which like a cherubin above them hover'd.
  Who, young and simple, would not be so lover'd?
  Ay me! I fell; and yet do question make
  What I should do again for such a sake.
  ```
