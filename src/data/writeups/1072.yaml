  #### Initial Analyisis

  Looking at the challenge you can observe it geting redirected `http://gc1.eng.run:32357/index.php?loop=0` to `http://gc1.eng.run:32357/index.php?loop=10` and there exist a encoded flag(`ivyiw{1m5_p3773e_70_h1l3_50i3_71b3}`) and and key `vigenere` is set to 1 at the localstorage of Browser which gives us the hint that used cipher to decode flag is vignere.

  #### solution

  So from our initial analysis we know we have to get a key to decode the `vigenere` cipher and the key is hidden in one of the requests.Now using the burpsuit we can navigate throught each and every requests starting from `/index.php?loop=0` to `/index.php?loop=10` at `/index.php?loop=5` in the Script tag the key getting added to localstorage.

  ```
  <script>window.localStorage.setItem('key', 'AIWPRTON');window.location.href='index.php?loop=6'</script>
  ```

  Now we have key and cipher text decoding them gives us the flag.
