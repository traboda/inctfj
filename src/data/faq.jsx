            No. InCTF is a Capture The Flag Championship, which is a more practical hands-on computer security competition.
            Unlike quizzes, a participant will be working with actual tools & using problem solving skills to solve
            challenges and obtain a flag that earns them points.

            <p>
                CTFs (Abbreviation for Capture The Flag) are a type of computer security competition.
                Contestants are presented with a set of challenges which test their creativity, technical (and googling)
                skills, and problem-solving ability. Challenges usually cover a number of categories, and when solved,
                each yields a string (called a flag) which is submitted to an online scoring service.
            </p>
            <p>
                CTFs are a great way to learn a wide array of computer security skills in a safe, legal environment,
                and are hosted and played by many security groups around the world for fun and practice.
