      No. InCTF is a Capture The Flag Championship, which is a more practical hands-on computer security competition.
      Unlike quizzes, a participant will be working with actual tools & using problem solving skills to solve
      challenges and obtain a flag that earns them points.

      <p>
        CTFs (Abbreviation for Capture The Flag) are a type of computer security competition.
        Contestants are presented with a set of challenges which test their creativity, technical (and googling)
        skills, and problem-solving ability. Challenges usually cover a number of categories, and when solved,
        each yields a string (called a flag) which is submitted to an online scoring service.
      </p>
      <p>
        CTFs are a great way to learn a wide array of computer security skills in a safe, legal environment,
        and are hosted and played by many security groups around the world for fun and practice.
